DESCRIPTION:
- This is a small program written in C.
- It takes two numbers between 1 and 20 (1 and 20 included) and converts any number that is under 10 to its equivalent in words (ex: 7 becomes "seven").
- However, any number that is equal or higher than 10 is printed to be either even or odd.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
1 - Open your terminal
2 - Type in "make" (the main.c file will compile and produce the main executable)
3 - Type in ./main followed by two numbers (ex: ./main 7 10)

Good luck!
